### Software Maintenance, Versioning, and Backward Compatibility Plan

This plan outlines strategies for managing software maintenance, versioning, and ensuring backward compatibility for the Car Rental System.

---

## 1. Software Maintenance

**1.1 Regular Updates**
- **Bug Fixes**: Monitor the system for bugs reported by users or found during testing. Fix bugs promptly to ensure smooth operation.
- **Performance Improvements**: Regularly analyze system performance, including database queries and user interactions. Optimize code and queries to improve response times and resource usage.
- **Security Patches**: Stay updated on security vulnerabilities in dependencies (e.g., MySQL connector). Apply patches or updates to mitigate security risks.

**1.2 Feature Enhancements**
- **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from users (both customers and admins) to identify areas for improvement. Prioritize feature requests based on user needs and development resources.
- **Incremental Development**: Introduce new features incrementally. Ensure that each release is well-tested to minimize disruptions.

**1.3 Documentation Maintenance**
- **Code Documentation**: Keep the codebase well-documented. Update comments and documentation files as new features are added or existing ones are modified.
- **User Documentation**: Regularly update the README file and any user guides to reflect the current state of the system.

**1.4 Technical Debt Management**
- **Code Refactoring**: Periodically review the codebase for areas that can be refactored to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly review and update third-party libraries and dependencies to their latest stable versions.

## 2. Versioning Strategy

**2.1 Semantic Versioning**
- **Version Numbering**: Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for version control. Use the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
  - **MAJOR**: Incremented when making incompatible API changes.
  - **MINOR**: Incremented when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
  - **PATCH**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.
  
**2.2 Release Management**
- **Stable Releases**: Mark releases that are thoroughly tested and deemed stable with the version number (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
- **Pre-Releases**: Use pre-release tags (e.g., `v1.1.0-beta`) for versions that are not yet stable and are intended for testing purposes.
- **Changelog Maintenance**: Maintain a detailed changelog documenting all changes, fixes, and new features in each version. This helps users and developers track updates and understand the impact of upgrades.

**2.3 Version Control System (VCS)**
- **Git Usage**: Use Git as the version control system. Maintain a `main` branch for stable releases and `develop` for ongoing development. Create feature branches for specific enhancements or fixes.
- **Tagging Releases**: Tag releases in Git with the corresponding version number (e.g., `v1.0.0`) to clearly mark the history of releases.

## 3. Backward Compatibility

**3.1 Compatibility Policy**
- **Stable API Contracts**: Ensure that API contracts (methods, classes, database schemas) remain stable across minor and patch versions. Avoid breaking changes that would require users to modify their existing code.
- **Deprecation Strategy**: When changes are necessary, mark features or methods as deprecated and provide a clear migration path. Maintain deprecated features for at least one major version before removal.

**3.2 Database Schema Changes**
- **Schema Versioning**: Track database schema versions and provide migration scripts that can be applied incrementally.
- **Backward-Compatible Migrations**: Design database migrations to be backward-compatible. Ensure that older versions of the system can still operate with newer schema versions until the next major release.
- **Feature Flags**: Implement feature flags to control the rollout of new features that might impact backward compatibility. This allows for gradual introduction while maintaining compatibility with existing functionality.

**3.3 Testing for Compatibility**
- **Regression Testing**: Perform extensive regression testing before releasing new versions. Ensure that existing features work as expected with the new changes.
- **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Create automated tests that specifically check for backward compatibility with previous versions. These tests should cover API calls, database interactions, and user interfaces.
